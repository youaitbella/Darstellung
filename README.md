Transforms the old browser-data-format into the new format for the 
web-application. It also creates the needed directories and moves the relevant 
files into it. If everything went right, you should see a new year-menu on 
http://browser.inek.org.

Usage of the tool:
BrowserFiles.exe <Path to folder including the transformable files> <Data-Year>
